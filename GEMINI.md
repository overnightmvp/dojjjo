# GEMINI.md - Your Master Plan

## The Brutal Reality Check

You have three business models. Your goal is $20k cash, fast.

*   **The $5k Consultant:** High ticket, but slow sales and complex delivery.
*   **The $15k-$50k Expert:** Even higher ticket, but a marathon sales cycle and very difficult to deliver solo.
*   **The HVAC Lead Generator:** Your best bet. It's a repeatable system with a clear path to recurring revenue. It's the most direct path to consistent cash flow.

**The Plan:** Focus 100% on the HVAC Lead Generation business. Stop trying to connect everything. Execute this one thing flawlessly.

## The $20k ASAP Plan: HVAC Lead Generation

**Phase 1: Launch (Weeks 1-2)**

1.  **Setup (1-2 days):**
    *   [ ] Get a Google Voice number.
    *   [ ] Set up a Formspree account.
    *   [ ] Update the landing page with the new phone number and form endpoint.
    *   [ ] Set up Google Analytics.
2.  **Contractor Outreach (3-5 days):**
    *   [ ] Refine email templates in `OMVP-home-service/outreach/email-templates.md`.
    *   [ ] Send personalized emails to the top 10 contractors in `OMVP-home-service/outreach/contractor-research.md`.
    *   [ ] Goal: Get one contractor to agree to a trial.
3.  **Launch Ads (1 day):**
    *   [ ] Set up the Facebook Ads campaign as detailed in `OMVP-home-service/ads/facebook-strategy.md`.
    *   [ ] Start with a $50/day budget.
    *   [ ] Launch the ads.

**Phase 2: Validation & Scaling (Weeks 3-8)**

1.  **Lead Management:**
    *   [ ] Manually qualify leads and send them to your contractor client.
    *   [ ] Use the Google Sheet template in the `OMVP-home-service/systems` directory to track everything.
2.  **Get Paid:**
    *   [ ] Invoice your contractor at the end of the first week.
3.  **Scale:**
    *   [ ] Use your success story to sign up 2-3 more contractors.
    *   [ ] Goal: 3 contractors paying for 15 leads/month each ($3,375/month).

To reach $20k, you need to bill for ~267 leads. With 3 contractors, you can hit this in 2-3 months.
