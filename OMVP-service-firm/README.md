# OMVP for Professional Services Firms

## What This Is

I've figured out how to automate the boring, time-consuming stuff that professional services firms deal with every day. Instead of you spending 2 years and a bunch of money figuring it out yourself, I can show you what works and give you someone to help implement it.

## Who This Helps

- Law firms that are drowning in unqualified leads
- CPA firms that hate their manual client onboarding process  
- Wealth management firms that can't keep track of follow-ups
- Any professional services firm making $500K+ that feels disorganized

## How It Works

1. **You get my system** - Everything I've learned about automating professional services
2. **You get a VA** - Someone who knows how to implement it properly (20-60 hours/month depending on package)
3. **We stay in touch** - Monthly or weekly calls to optimize and fix problems

## What You Get

- Lead qualification that actually works
- Client onboarding that doesn't take 20 emails
- Follow-up that happens automatically
- Systems that work when you're not there
- Less time on $15/hour work when you bill $300/hour

## Investment

- **$15K** - System + VA (20 hours/month)
- **$25K** - System + VA (40 hours/month) + more complex automations
- **$50K** - System + VA (60 hours/month) + weekly optimization calls

## No BS Promises

I can't guarantee you'll make X more money - that depends on your business, your market, your execution. What I can tell you is that every firm I've worked with stops wasting huge amounts of time on manual processes and actually knows where their leads come from.

Most people find it pays for itself pretty quickly when they stop doing admin work at partner rates.

## Next Steps

If this sounds interesting, let's have a conversation about your current situation and see if it makes sense to work together.

No hard sell, no pressure - just an honest discussion about whether this would help your specific situation.
