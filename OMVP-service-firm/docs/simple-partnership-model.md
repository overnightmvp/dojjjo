# Simple Partnership Approach

## How to Talk About This (No Sales BS)

### The Basic Conversation

*"I've spent the last few years figuring out how to automate all the manual stuff that eats up time in professional services firms. You know - lead qualification, client onboarding, follow-up systems. Instead of you trying to figure it out from scratch, I can show you exactly what I do, and I'll give you someone who helps implement it."*

### When They Ask What You Guarantee

*"I can't promise you'll make X more money - that depends on your business, your market, how well you execute. What I can tell you is that the firms I work with stop wasting 20-30 hours a week on manual tasks, and they actually know where their leads come from. Most people see that as pretty valuable."*

### When They Ask About Price

*"Working together costs $15K, $25K, or $50K depending on how much VA support you want. I know it's not cheap, but think about it - you're probably wasting $10K+ every month on manual processes. This fixes that. Plus the VA alone would cost you $4K/month if you hired directly."*

## Why Partnership vs Service

### Partnership Language:
- "Working together"
- "Here's what I've learned"
- "The system I've developed"
- "Usually takes about 3 months"

### Avoid Service Language:
- "We guarantee X results"
- "Proven methodology"
- "Implementation timeline"
- "ROI analysis"

## Positioning the VA

### How to Explain It:
*"You'll work with Sarah - she's helped me set this up for 15+ other firms, so she knows exactly what works and what doesn't. Think of her like a really good project manager who actually knows how to build this stuff."*

### When They Worry About Quality:
*"Sarah's not just any VA - she's specifically trained on my system. She's done this enough times that she can spot problems before they happen. If something's not working, she escalates to me."*

## Handling Common Objections

### "What if it doesn't work?"
*"This system has worked for similar firms because it addresses the fundamental problems every professional services firm faces. Your VA will implement each step with you, so success comes from following what we know works."*

### "That's expensive for no guarantee"
*"You're not paying for guarantees - you're investing in a system that would take you 2+ years to develop internally, plus someone who knows how to implement it correctly. Most firms spend more than this annually on inefficient manual processes."*

### "How do I know you're legit?"
*"Fair question. Here's what I've done for other firms like yours... [specific examples]. Want to talk to a couple of them?"*

## The Three Options

### Option 1 - $15K
*"You get my complete system plus Sarah works with you 20 hours a month to implement it. Good if you have someone internally who can coordinate."*

### Option 2 - $25K  
*"Same as above, but Sarah works 40 hours a month and handles more complex stuff like client onboarding workflows. Most firms find this is the sweet spot."*

### Option 3 - $50K
*"Sarah becomes like part of your team at 60 hours a month, plus we talk weekly about optimization. For firms that want hands-off implementation."*

## What Success Looks Like

*"After 3 months, you should feel way less overwhelmed by admin stuff, know where your leads are coming from, and have systems that actually work instead of everything being scattered across email and spreadsheets."*

**Specific Examples:**
- You're not personally handling every single lead inquiry
- New clients get onboarded without 20 back-and-forth emails  
- You actually know which marketing is working
- Follow-up happens automatically instead of falling through cracks
- You can go on vacation without everything falling apart

## Questions to Ask Them

Instead of formal discovery, just have a normal conversation:

- "What's eating up most of your time right now?"
- "How are you currently getting new clients?" 
- "What happens when someone contacts you - walk me through that process"
- "Are you happy with how organized everything is, or is it kind of chaotic?"
- "If you could fix one thing about running the business, what would it be?"

## The Simple Close

*"Based on what you've told me, I think this would help with [specific things they mentioned]. Want to move forward? We can get Sarah introduced this week and start mapping out your current processes."*

*"Or if you want to think about it, no problem. Happy to answer any questions."*

## Red Flags (Don't Work With These People)

- Want guarantees or "proof it works" before starting
- Expect immediate results without any implementation effort  
- Don't want to work with VA or external support
- Want to modify the system before trying it
- Focus only on price rather than the value of fixing their chaos

## Green Lights (Good Partners)

- Frustrated with current manual processes
- Understand that systems take time to implement properly
- Have team member who can coordinate with VA
- See the value in methodology + implementation support
- Think long-term about business improvement
