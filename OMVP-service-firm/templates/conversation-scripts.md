# Conversation Scripts (Natural Language)

## Opening Conversations

### When Someone Asks What You Do
*"I help professional services firms - lawyers, CPAs, wealth managers - automate all the manual stuff that eats up their time. You know, lead qualification, client onboarding, follow-up systems. Instead of them spending years figuring it out, I share what I've learned and give them someone to help implement it."*

### When They Ask How It Works
*"Pretty simple really. You get my system - everything I've figured out about automating professional services over the last few years. Plus I give you a VA who's done this setup 20+ times before, so they know exactly what works and what doesn't. Takes about 3 months to get everything running smoothly."*

## Handling Specific Questions

### "What kind of results do you guarantee?"
*"I can't guarantee specific results - there are too many variables I don't control, like your market, your execution, your team. What I can tell you is that every firm I've worked with stops wasting huge amounts of time on manual processes and actually knows where their leads come from. Most people find that pretty valuable."*

### "How much does it cost?"
*"Working together is $15K, $25K, or $50K depending on how much VA support you want. I know it's not cheap. But think about it - if you're a partner billing $300/hour and you're spending 20 hours a week on admin work, that's $6,000 a week you're leaving on the table. This fixes that."*

### "What if it doesn't work for our firm?"
*"Fair concern. This system works because it addresses the fundamental problems every professional services firm faces - lead qualification, client onboarding, follow-up systems. Your VA will implement each piece with you, so success comes from following what we know works. I've never had someone follow the system properly and not see improvement."*

### "How do I know you're legit?"
*"Totally fair question. Here's what I've done for firms similar to yours... [give specific examples]. Want to talk to a couple of them? I can connect you with similar firms who've been through this process."*

### "We're too busy to implement something new right now"
*"I hear that a lot, and honestly, that's exactly why you need this. When you're drowning in manual processes, you never have time to fix the processes. The VA handles 90% of the implementation work - that's kind of the whole point. You're not taking on another project, you're getting someone to systematize what you're already doing."*

### "Can we start with something smaller?"
*"I get the hesitation, but here's the thing - partial automation often makes things worse, not better. You end up with some automated and some manual, which creates more confusion. The system works because it's comprehensive. That said, we can phase the implementation so you're not overwhelmed."*

## Price Objection Handling

### "That's expensive"
*"Compared to what? Most firms spend more than this annually on inefficient processes. Plus the VA alone would cost you $4K+ per month if you hired directly. So really, you're paying for the methodology and getting discounted implementation help."*

### "We need to think about it"
*"Of course. This isn't a small decision. What specific concerns do you have? I'm happy to address those now rather than have you wondering about them."*

### "We need to discuss it as partners"
*"Makes sense. What would help that conversation? I can put together some specific examples of how this would work for your type of firm, or we could do a brief call with your other partners to answer questions."*

## Qualifying Questions (Natural Conversation Flow)

### Getting Them Talking:
- *"What's eating up most of your time right now that you wish you could automate?"*
- *"Walk me through what happens when someone contacts your firm - from first contact to becoming a client."*
- *"How are you currently getting new clients? What's working and what isn't?"*
- *"What would have to happen for you to feel like your business processes are actually organized?"*

### Understanding Their Pain:
- *"How much time would you say partners spend on admin work each week?"*
- *"What happens when someone in your firm goes on vacation - does everything still run smoothly?"*
- *"Do you have a good handle on which marketing actually brings in clients, or is that kind of a mystery?"*

### Budget Qualification:
- *"Have you looked into solutions for this before? What's stopped you from implementing something?"*
- *"If you could fix these problems, what would that be worth to your firm annually?"*
- *"Are you the person who makes decisions about investing in business systems, or are there other partners involved?"*

## Positioning the Three Options

### $15K Option
*"This gives you my complete system plus Sarah works with you 20 hours a month to implement it. Good if you have someone internally who can coordinate and you're comfortable with a more hands-off approach."*

### $25K Option (Recommend This One)
*"This is what most firms choose. Same system, but Sarah works 40 hours a month and handles more complex stuff like client onboarding workflows. Most firms find this hits the sweet spot between support and cost."*

### $50K Option
*"This is for firms that want completely hands-off implementation. Sarah becomes like part of your team at 60 hours a month, plus we talk weekly about optimization. For partners who just want it handled without thinking about it."*

## Closing Conversations

### Soft Close
*"Based on what you've told me about [specific pain points they mentioned], I think this would make a big difference for your firm. What questions do you have about moving forward?"*

### Direct Close
*"Sounds like this could solve the exact problems you're dealing with. Want to get started? We could have Sarah introduced this week and begin mapping out your current processes."*

### Alternative Close
*"Would you rather think about it more, or should we set up a time to talk through the implementation plan?"*

## Follow-up Scripts

### If They Need Time
*"No problem at all. These aren't small decisions. I'll follow up in a week to answer any questions that come up. In the meantime, feel free to email me if you think of anything."*

### If They Want References
*"Absolutely. Let me connect you with [specific firm type] who went through this process 6 months ago. They can give you the real story about what it's like to work with us."*

### If Budget is an Issue
*"I understand budget is a concern. Let me ask - what's the cost of not fixing this? If partners are spending 20 hours a week on admin work, that's probably costing you $50K+ monthly in opportunity cost. But I get that cash flow is different from opportunity cost."*

## Red Flag Responses (Don't Work With These People)

- *"Can you guarantee we'll get X number of leads?"*
- *"We want to modify your system before implementing it"*
- *"Can we get the system and implement it ourselves?"*
- *"We need this to pay for itself in 30 days"*
- *"We don't want to work with a VA"*

## Green Light Responses (Good Prospects)

- *"We're tired of feeling disorganized"*
- *"Partners are spending too much time on admin work"*
- *"We know we need systems but don't know where to start"*
- *"We've tried to fix this ourselves but it's overwhelming"*
- *"We understand this takes time to implement properly"*
