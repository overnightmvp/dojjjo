# CPA Firm Automation Example

## Before: Tax & Advisory Firm Chaos

### The Situation
**Miller CPA & Associates** - 2 partners, 12 staff, $1.8M annual revenue

**Daily Reality:**
- Tax season = 70-hour weeks for everyone
- Client document collection is a nightmare every year
- Advisory services offered but only 20% of clients use them
- No systematic way to follow up on leads or proposals
- Partners doing data entry instead of client advisory work

**Specific Pain Points:**
- *"Tax season nearly kills us every year"*
- *"Clients send documents in random emails, texts, and dropoffs"*
- *"We know our clients need advisory services but we can't find time to sell them"*
- *"Half our proposals never get responded to"*

## How Our System Helps

### Tax Season Document Collection
**Before:** Clients email/text/drop off documents randomly
**After:** Systematic collection with automated reminders and organized portal

**The System:**
- Client portal for secure document upload
- Automated reminders starting in December
- Document checklists specific to their tax situation
- Status tracking for both client and firm
- Integration with tax software

**Result:** 80% of documents collected before February 1st instead of last-minute chaos

### Advisory Services Upselling
**Before:** Partners mention advisory services if they remember
**After:** Systematic identification and follow-up on advisory opportunities

**The Process:**
1. Tax return review identifies advisory opportunities automatically
2. Client receives personalized recommendations via email
3. Advisory consultation automatically scheduled if interested
4. Follow-up sequences for different advisory services
5. Annual business review scheduled for all business clients

**Result:** Advisory revenue increased from 20% to 45% of total revenue

### Proposal Follow-up System
**Before:** Send proposal and hope for the best
**After:** Systematic follow-up that actually gets responses

**The System:**
- Proposal delivery confirmation
- Automated follow-up sequence (day 3, 7, 14, 21)
- Personalized messages based on proposal type
- Meeting booking integration for questions
- Won/lost tracking for continuous improvement

**Result:** Proposal response rate increased from 40% to 78%

## What the Managing Partner Says

*"Tax season used to be absolute hell. Now it's actually manageable. Sarah set up systems that our clients love - they know exactly what to send and when. But the real game-changer was the advisory services automation. We went from hoping clients would ask about advisory work to systematically identifying opportunities. Our advisory revenue more than doubled in one year."*
