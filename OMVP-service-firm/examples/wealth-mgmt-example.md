# Wealth Management Automation Example

## Before: Financial Advisory Firm Chaos

### The Situation
**Heritage Wealth Advisors** - 3 advisors, 6 support staff, $2.5M annual revenue

**Daily Reality:**
- Advisors spending 40% of time on administrative tasks
- Client reviews happen sporadically when advisors remember
- No systematic follow-up on referral introductions
- Compliance documentation scattered across multiple systems
- New client onboarding takes 6-8 weeks

**Specific Pain Points:**
- *"We're supposed to do quarterly reviews but most clients get reviewed twice a year at best"*
- *"Referral introductions fall through the cracks constantly"*
- *"New clients get frustrated with our slow onboarding process"*
- *"Advisors are doing data entry instead of financial planning"*

## How Our System Helps

### Systematic Client Review Process

**After:** Automated scheduling and preparation for all client reviews

**The System:**
- Automated quarterly review scheduling based on client risk profile
- Pre-review reports generated automatically
- Client questionnaires sent before meetings
- Meeting prep checklists for advisors
- Follow-up task automation post-meeting

**Result:** 98% of clients now receive quarterly reviews on schedule

### Referral Management System

**After:** Systematic process from introduction to conversion

**The Process:**
1. Referral source information captured systematically

**The System:**

## What the Managing Partner Says

*"The client review automation alone was worth the investment. Before, reviews were hit-or-miss depending on how busy we were. Now every client gets systematic attention, and our satisfaction scores prove it. But the referral system transformation was incredible - we went from losing track of referrals to having a waiting list of prospects. Sarah knew exactly what needed to be done and implemented everything while we kept serving clients."*
