- "Every failed tender = free market research for your competitors"

### Social Proof (To Be Implemented)
- "[X]% win rate vs. industry average [Y]%"
- "â‚¬[X]M+ in tender value won for clients"
- "[X] tenders won against [major competitors]"
- "Audrey's methodology beats [X]% of traditional approaches"

### Urgency Triggers
- "Next tender deadline = next opportunity for competitors to gain advantage"
- "Transform your approach now or keep funding your competitors' growth"
- "Strategic advantage disappears when everyone else adapts (but you don't)"

### Authority Positioning
- "15+ years defeating tender competitors with brutal honesty about what actually wins"
- "The consultant your competitors don't want you to find"
- "Methodology that turns tender responses into competitive weapons"
