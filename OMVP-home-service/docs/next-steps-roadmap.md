5. **Move fast** - Summer peak season is May-September

### Must-Avoid Mistakes:
‚ùå **Trying multiple services** (AC repair, heating, plumbing, etc.)
‚ùå **Competing on price** instead of quality
‚ùå **Accepting bad contractors** for quick revenue
‚ùå **Ignoring mobile experience** (60%+ of traffic)

## üéØ KEY DECISIONS TO MAKE TODAY

### Decision 1: Commitment Level
**Question**: Are you ready to abandon other projects and focus 100% on this for 90 days?

### Decision 2: Initial Budget
**Question**: Can you invest $2,000-3,000 in the first month? ($50-100/day ads + tools)
**Why it matters**: Underfunding leads to poor results and early failure

### Decision 3: Geographic Focus
**Question**: Phoenix, AZ as your target market?
**Why it matters**: Climate creates urgency, competitor analysis complete

### Decision 4: Timeline
**Question**: Can you dedicate 20+ hours/week for the first month?
**Why it matters**: Fast execution beats perfect planning in lead generation

## üöÄ THE BRUTAL TRUTH

**This Will Work IF**:
- You focus on ONE city, ONE service type
- You prioritize lead quality over quantity
- You treat contractors as customers (they pay you)
- You move fast during peak season (May-September)
- You track metrics and optimize based on data

**This Will Fail IF**:
- You try to do everything at once
- You compete on price instead of quality
- You ignore contractor feedback and requirements
- You overcomplicate systems before proving demand
- You get distracted by other "opportunities"

**Your Choice**: Commit fully to this model for 90 days, or don't start at all. Half-measures guarantee failure.

---

**Next Action**: Make the four key decisions above, then execute Day 1-2 tasks. The contractors who set up emergency lead generation before May always have their best summers.

**Time is money. Summer heat is coming. Let's build this machine.**
