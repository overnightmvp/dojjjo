## Template 1: Problem-Focused (Tier 1 Prospects)

**Subject**: Are you losing emergency AC calls to competitors?

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I was looking at HVAC companies in Phoenix and noticed something interesting about [Company Name]...

Your Google reviews are excellent (4.2 stars!), but when I searched "emergency AC repair Phoenix" on my phone, you didn't show up in the top results.

That's a problem because 73% of emergency AC calls now start with a mobile Google search.

Here's what's happening:
‚Ä¢ Homeowners search "emergency AC repair" at 2 AM
‚Ä¢ They find your competitors with mobile-optimized pages
‚Ä¢ They call them instead of you

I've built a simple system that gets you found first for emergency calls. It's already working for 3 HVAC companies in Texas (averaging 12-15 qualified leads per month).

The best part? You only pay for actual leads that meet your criteria:
‚úì Phoenix metro area homeowners
‚úì AC completely broken (not maintenance calls)  
‚úì Ready to pay service call fee
‚úì Available for same-day appointment

Would you be interested in a 10-minute call to see how this works?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. Summer's coming fast. The contractors who set this up in April always have their best months in June-August.

## Template 2: Cost-Savings Focus (Tier 2 Prospects)

**Subject**: Cut your lead costs in half (while doubling quality)

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much are you paying per lead on HomeAdvisor/Angie's List?

If it's more than $75, you're overpaying. And if you're competing with 3+ contractors for each lead, you're definitely overpaying.

I help Phoenix HVAC contractors generate their own emergency repair leads for $75 each. No competition, no bidding wars, no HomeAdvisor fees.

Here's how it works:
1. I build you an emergency-focused landing page
2. I run targeted ads to Phoenix homeowners with broken AC
3. Qualified leads go directly to you (no middleman)
4. You pay $75 per lead that meets your criteria

Recent results:
‚Ä¢ Desert Air: 18 leads in March, 14 converted to service calls
‚Ä¢ Phoenix Comfort: 22 leads in February, $12,000 additional revenue

The leads are higher quality because they come directly to you, not through a platform where everyone looks the same.

Interested in a quick 10-minute call to see if this makes sense for [Company Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. One of my clients fired HomeAdvisor last month. He's saving $400/month in platform fees while getting better leads.

## Template 3: Competitive Advantage (Tier 3 Prospects)

**Subject**: How Cool Blew is stealing your millennial customers

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I was researching Phoenix HVAC companies and noticed something that might concern you...

When millennials (ages 25-40) search for "emergency AC repair Phoenix" on their phones, Cool Blew shows up first. Every time.

This matters because:
‚Ä¢ Millennials are now 42% of Phoenix homeowners
‚Ä¢ They have higher household incomes than older generations  
‚Ä¢ They make buying decisions within hours, not days
‚Ä¢ They rarely call - they fill out forms online first

[Company Name] has better reviews and more experience than Cool Blew, but they're getting found first for the most valuable demographic.

I've helped 3 HVAC companies in similar situations capture more of the millennial market. The key is having an emergency-focused mobile experience that speaks their language.

Results from similar companies:
‚Ä¢ Average customer age dropped from 52 to 38
‚Ä¢ Service call values increased 23% (millennials buy more add-ons)
‚Ä¢ Same-day bookings increased 67%

Would you be interested in a brief call to discuss how [Company Name] could capture more of this market?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. The contractors who move fast on this always have their best years. The ones who wait usually regret it.

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up #1 (48 hours later)

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject] - Quick follow-up

```
Hi [Name],

I sent you a quick note about emergency AC lead generation yesterday - not sure if you had a chance to see it.

I know you're busy, so here's the bottom line:

‚Ä¢ I generate 10-20 qualified emergency AC leads per month
‚Ä¢ Phoenix homeowners only, broken AC only  
‚Ä¢ $75 per lead (you only pay for leads that meet your criteria)
‚Ä¢ No long-term contracts, no setup fees

Worth a 10-minute conversation? I'm free Tuesday 2-4 PM or Thursday 10-12 PM.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (1 week later)

**Subject**: Last follow-up - emergency AC season starting

```
Hi [Name],

This is my last follow-up about emergency AC lead generation for [Company Name].

Summer heat is starting early this year - Phoenix hit 105¬∞F yesterday and it's only April. That means emergency AC calls are about to spike.

The HVAC companies who get set up with dedicated emergency lead generation in the next 2 weeks always have their best summers.

If you want to discuss how this could work for [Company Name], I'm free for a 10-minute call through Friday.

After that, I'll focus on the contractors who are ready to move forward.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. One of my clients just told me they're booked solid through next Tuesday because of the heat wave. That's the difference good lead generation makes.
