From Broke to Bangkok: How I Built Unsustainable Businesses in 4 Countries (so You Don't Have To)
Friend,
Let me tell you a story.

Ten years ago, I was a kid fresh out of high school, very interested in smoking joints and martial arts, not much websites.

Fast forward five years, and I'd not only sold my first website, but I had a thriving development house, a team, and the trappings of success ‚Äì rooftop pool, nice cars, the whole shebang.

RTY PHOTOFAcebook memory https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1189401744404054&set=a.555621414448760

But here's the thing...

it wasn't sustainable.

That flashy life crashed and burned.

It took me another five years, three failed startups in 3 countries, and two brushes with bankruptcy to understand what truly matters:

Building businesses that last.

Fuck up photo

Crazy shit happens
‚Äç
Today, I'm a seasoned designer who's helped founders in four countries turn their ideas into profitable, sustainable businesses.

I've seen the mistakes, the dead ends, and the shortcuts that actually work.

Here's what I know for sure:
‚Äç
Simple can be powerful.
You don't need a million-dollar marketing campaign to succeed.

A single landing page, a handful of emails, and the right systems can generate serious revenue.

Clarity is king.
Before you build anything, you need a crystal-clear understanding of your product, your audience, and your goals.

My #1 Worksheet will help you achieve that clarity. (Download it for free!)

Processes are the engine.
Automation, templates, and well-defined systems are the secret sauce of sustainable growth. I'll show you how to build them.

Maybe you recognize yourself in my story. You have a great idea, but you're drowning in complexity.

You're unsure how to turn your vision into reality.

That's where I can help.

I'm not just a consultant, I'm a collaborator.

I'll bring my expertise and experience to the table, but I'll also get my hands dirty, designing and implementing the systems you need.

Imagine this:

A business that runs like a well-oiled machine, freeing you to focus on what matters most.

A system for scaling your services and delivering on your promises, consistently.

The freedom and flexibility to live and work from anywhere in the world (like me in Bangkok!).

Stop letting your ideas gather dust.

Let's build something real, something that lasts.

Download my free #1 Worksheet today and see if we're a good fit.

Talk soon,
Johnny Toshio

P.S.  Want proof that this works? Check out my project "Bangkok Jiu-Jitsu" ‚Äì a one-page website designed to dominate the local search market and fuel the growth of my future BJJ gym.
Live count.
Simple, yet powerful.
