## Key Transformation Elements

### Visual Brutalization
```css
/* Before: Generic, safe colors */
:root {
  --primary: #6366f1;
  --secondary: #8b5cf6;
  --background: #f8fafc;
}

/* After: Brutal, conversion-optimized */
:root {
  --brutal-red: #ef4444;
  --brutal-orange: #f97316;  
  --brutal-black: #111827;
  --brutal-shadow: 4px 4px 0px var(--brutal-black);
}
```

### Message Transformation
**Before**: "Streamline your project management with our intuitive platform"
**After**: "‚ö° Stop Wasting Time on Broken Project Management. Start Shipping Products That Matter."

**Before**: "Try free for 14 days"  
**After**: "Get Brutal Project Control üî• (or keep failing with generic tools)"

### Psychology Implementation
- **Fear Appeal**: "67% of projects fail due to poor management. Don't be a statistic."
- **Social Proof**: "$2.3M+ in revenue saved for 1,847+ teams"
- **Urgency**: "Every day with broken PM = missed deadlines and lost revenue"
- **Authority**: "Used by founders who ship products, not excuses"
