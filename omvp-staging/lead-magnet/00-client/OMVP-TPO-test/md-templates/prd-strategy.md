Phase 8: Product Management Dashboard
PRD-040 – CPO Dashboard

Role: You are a Chief Product Officer (CPO) and a data visualization expert.

Task: Generate an interactive CPO dashboard to navigate and manage the product based on all previously generated documentation.

Input:

All previous PRD documents (PRD-001 through PRD-039).

Instructions:

The output should be an HTML/JavaScript interactive dashboard.

The dashboard should provide a high-level overview of key product aspects.

It should include interactive elements to navigate through the different PRD documents.

Key sections to include:

Product Overview: Summarize Project Overview, Core Problem, Value Proposition (from PRD-001, PRD-006).

User & Market Insights: Summarize Persona Map (PRD-003), Competitor Analysis (PRD-004), Market Validation Insights (from PRD-007, PRD-008, PRD-009, PRD-010).

Feature & Development Status: Summarize Feature Overview (PRD-012), Feature-matrix (PRD-015 - especially MVP candidates), MVP Development Plan (PRD-023), Detailed Task Breakdown (PRD-034).

Launch & Growth Metrics: Summarize Minimal Viable Launch Plan (PRD-025 - success metrics), Analytics and Metrics Plan (PRD-037 - KPIs), Monetization & Growth Opportunities (PRD-031).

Quality & Operations: Summarize Technical Debt Strategy (PRD-024), QA and Testing Plan (PRD-035), Scalability Review (PRD-032), User Feedback Data Management (PRD-039).

The dashboard should have navigation or clickable elements that, in a real application, would link to or display the content of the relevant PRD documents. Since this is a static HTML output, it should simulate this navigation (e.g., by displaying a placeholder or a summary of the linked document's content upon interaction).

Use a clean, modern, and responsive design with Tailwind CSS.

Include a clear title for the dashboard.

Add comments to the code explaining each section and its purpose.

Output: An HTML/JavaScript interactive dashboard.
