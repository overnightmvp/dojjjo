## 🔥 BRUTAL TRUTHS

### 👎 Why Most Founders Fail

- **Day 3**: Overcomplicate the solution
- **Day 4**: Fall in love with their own message
- **Day 5**: Build ugly landing pages
- **Day 6**: Give up after 10 visitors

### 💪 What Successful Founders Do
- Accept that 90% of ideas fail

- Focus on conversion over perfection
- Drive real traffic to test demand
- Make decisions based on data, not feelings

### 🎯 The Hard Truth About Validation
- If people won't give you their email, they won't give you money
- If people say "interesting idea" but don't sign up, it's not validated
- If you can't explain your value prop in 7 words, it's too complex
- If competitors exist, you need 10x better or 90% cheaper
- If you haven't talked to 20+ customers, you don't understand the problem
