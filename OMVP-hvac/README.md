## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why Phoenix specifically?**
A: 110°F+ temperatures create genuine emergencies. Broken AC isn't just inconvenient - it's dangerous. This urgency drives immediate conversions.

**Q: Why $75 per lead?**
A: Contractors currently pay $100-250 for shared leads from HomeAdvisor. Our exclusive leads at $75 are a bargain with higher conversion rates.

**Q: What if contractors don't pay?**
A: Net 15 payment terms with automated invoicing. Poor-paying contractors get cut off immediately - plenty of prospects in queue.

**Q: How do you ensure lead quality?**
A: Strict qualification: Phoenix metro homeowners only, AC completely broken (not maintenance), available for same-day service.

**Q: What about seasonality?**
A: 70% of revenue comes May-September, but Phoenix needs heating repairs in winter. Year-round business with seasonal peaks.
