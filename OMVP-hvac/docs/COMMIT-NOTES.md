## 🎯 Strategic Decisions Made

### Geographic Focus
- **Phoenix, AZ selected** as primary market
- Reasoning: 110°F+ temps create genuine emergencies
- Expansion plan: Tucson/Las Vegas in Month 3

### Service Focus
- **Emergency AC repair only** (not maintenance/installation)
- Reasoning: Highest urgency = highest conversion rates
- Avoids complexity of multiple service offerings

### Pricing Strategy
- **$75 per qualified lead** (exclusive to contractor)
- Reasoning: 25-50% below competitor platforms
- Higher value due to exclusivity and quality

### Technology Stack
- **Static HTML/CSS/JS** (no complex frameworks)
- **Formspree** for form processing
- **Facebook Ads** for lead generation
- **Manual processes** initially (automate in Month 2)

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Avoid Mistakes
