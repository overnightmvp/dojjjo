# SEO Content Strategy: Dominating Emergency HVAC Search in Phoenix

## 1. The Brutal Reality of SEO

Your competitors have generic, boring websites with content that hasn't been updated since 2015. They are lazy. We will win by being more helpful and more specific.

Our strategy is not to just rank for keywords, but to own the conversation around "emergency HVAC situations in Phoenix." We will become the go-to resource for anyone whose AC has died in the middle of a heatwave.

## 2. Target Audience

A Phoenix homeowner, likely in their 30s-60s, in a state of panic. Their AC is broken, it's over 100Â°F, and they are worried about their family's safety, the cost of the repair, and getting ripped off. They are searching on their phone for immediate help.

## 3. Keyword Strategy

We will focus on high-intent, long-tail keywords that signal urgency and a need for immediate help.

### Primary "Money" Keywords

These are the keywords that will drive the most valuable leads.

*   emergency ac repair phoenix
*   same day ac repair phoenix
*   24 hour ac repair phoenix
*   ac repair phoenix az now
*   phoenix ac emergency service
*   ac not working phoenix
*   cost of emergency ac repair phoenix

### Secondary Informational Keywords

These keywords will help us build topical authority and capture users who are in the problem-aware stage.

*   what to do when ac stops working
*   how to know if ac is broken or just needs reset
*   how long can you stay in a house without ac in phoenix
*   average cost of ac repair in phoenix
*   how to prevent ac failure in summer
*   choosing an hvac contractor in phoenix

## 4. Content Pillars

We will build our content around three core pillars.

1.  **Emergency Guides:** Practical, step-by-step advice for homeowners in crisis.
2.  **Location-Specific Content:** Hyper-local pages targeting specific neighborhoods and suburbs of Phoenix.
3.  **Cost & Transparency:** Content that builds trust by being upfront about pricing and what to expect.

## 5. Content Gap Analysis

Your competitors are failing in three key areas:

1.  **Lack of Immediacy:** Their content is not written for someone who needs help *now*. It's generic and salesy.
2.  **No Geo-Targeting:** They have one page for "Phoenix" but not for Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, etc.
3.  **No Transparency:** They hide their pricing and use vague terms like "affordable."

We will exploit these gaps relentlessly.

## 6. Systematic Content Creation Plan

We will create a new `/blog` directory within the `/OMVP-home-service` folder to house this content. We will publish one new piece of content per week for the first 8 weeks.

## 7. Execution Workflow with Gemini CLI

To create this content, you will give me a simple command, and I will generate the content and save it to a file.

**Your Command:**
`"Gemini, execute week 1 of the SEO content plan."`

**My Actions:**
1.  I will retrieve the prompt for week 1 from this file.
2.  I will generate the blog post content.

We will repeat this process each week.

## 8. Measuring Success

We will track the following metrics:

*   **Keyword Rankings:** We will use a free tool like Google Search Console to track our rankings for the target keywords.
*   **Organic Traffic:** We will monitor the organic traffic to the `/OMVP-home-service/blog` directory in Google Analytics.
