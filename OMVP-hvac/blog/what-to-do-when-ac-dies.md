# What to Do Immediately When Your AC Dies in a Phoenix Heatwave

It’s a scenario every Phoenix resident dreads: the temperature is soaring past 100°F, and your air conditioner suddenly goes silent. The panic is real, but don't worry. Taking a few calm, measured steps can protect your home and keep your family safe while you wait for professional help.

This guide will walk you through exactly what to do.

## Your Immediate Action Checklist

Before you do anything else, run through this quick checklist. Sometimes, the fix is surprisingly simple.

*   **1. Check Your Thermostat:** Is it set to "Cool"? Is the set temperature lower than the current room temperature? It sounds basic, but accidental changes to the thermostat are a common cause for calls. Ensure it has fresh batteries if it's a battery-powered model.

*   **2. Check Your Circuit Breaker:** Head to your home's electrical panel. Find the breaker labeled "AC," "Air Conditioner," or "HVAC." Is it tripped? If it's in the middle or "Off" position, flip it completely off and then back on again. If it trips again immediately, do not reset it again. This indicates a more serious electrical problem that requires a professional.

*   **3. Check Your Air Filter:** A severely clogged air filter can restrict airflow and cause your AC system to overheat and shut down. If your filter is visibly dirty, replace it. This is a good monthly habit to get into anyway.

*   **4. Check the Outdoor Unit:** Look at your outdoor condenser unit. Is it blocked by overgrown plants, debris, or dirt? The unit needs at least two feet of clear space around it to function properly. Also, check if the fan is spinning.

If you've run through this checklist and your AC still isn't working, it's time to call for professional help. Do not attempt any further electrical or mechanical repairs yourself.

## How to Keep Your House Cool While You Wait

Once you've called for service, the next priority is to keep your home as cool as possible. Here are some effective strategies:

*   **Block Out the Sun:** Close all blinds, curtains, and drapes. This is your most effective weapon against solar heat gain. Pay special attention to west-facing and south-facing windows.

*   **Don't Use the Oven:** Avoid cooking with your oven or stovetop. This is a good excuse to order a pizza or have sandwiches for dinner. These appliances generate a significant amount of heat.

*   **Limit Electronics:** Turn off unnecessary lights and electronics. TVs, computers, and even light bulbs generate heat.

*   **Use Fans Correctly:** If you have ceiling fans, set them to run counter-clockwise to create a cooling downdraft. Use box fans or oscillating fans to create airflow in the rooms you are using.

*   **Stay Hydrated:** Make sure everyone in your household, including pets, is drinking plenty of water.

*   **Focus on One Room:** If possible, have your family congregate in a single room, preferably on the lowest level of your home and on the north side. Close the doors to other rooms to contain the cool air.
