# How to Survive a Phoenix Weekend Without AC

It's Friday afternoon, and your AC unit just died. You've called for emergency service, but the earliest a technician can get to you is Saturday morning. How do you survive a Phoenix weekend in 110Â°F heat without air conditioning?

While it won't be comfortable, it is manageable if you have a plan. Here is a practical survival guide.

## 1. Create a "Cool Room"

Don't try to cool your entire house. Choose one room, preferably on the north side of your house and on the lowest floor, to be your "cool room."

*   **Cover the Windows:** Use blackout curtains, blankets, or even cardboard to completely block all sunlight from coming into this room.
*   **Isolate the Room:** Close the door and place a towel at the bottom to seal the gap.
*   **Use Fans:** Set up box fans and oscillating fans to keep the air circulating within this room.

## 2. Use Water to Your Advantage

Water is your best friend in a heatwave.

*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink more water than you think you need. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can dehydrate you.
*   **Cool Showers:** Take cool (not cold) showers throughout the day to lower your body temperature.
*   **Wet Towels:** Place a cool, damp towel on your neck or forehead for immediate relief.

## 3. Get Out of the House

Sometimes, the best strategy is to not be in the house at all during the hottest parts of the day (typically 2 PM to 6 PM).

*   **Visit a "Cooling Center":** Many public libraries, community centers, and shopping malls serve as informal cooling centers.
*   **Go to the Movies:** Enjoy a matinee in a heavily air-conditioned theater.
*   **Visit a Friend or Family Member:** If you have friends or family with working AC, now is the time to pay them a visit.

## 4. Don't Add Extra Heat

Be mindful of activities that generate heat inside your home.

*   **No Cooking:** Avoid using your oven or stovetop. This is a perfect excuse for takeout or grilling outside.
*   **Unplug Electronics:** Turn off and unplug any electronics you're not using, including TVs and computers.
*   **Limit Hot Water Use:** Avoid long, hot showers or running the dishwasher, as these can add humidity and heat to your home.

## 5. Keep Your Pets Safe

Don't forget about your furry family members.

*   **Provide Plenty of Water:** Make sure they have multiple bowls of fresh, cool water.
*   **Cooling Mats or Wet Towels:** Have them lie on a cooling mat or a damp towel.
*   **Never Leave Them in a Car:** Even for a minute.
