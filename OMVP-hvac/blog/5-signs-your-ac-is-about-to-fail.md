# 5 Signs Your AC is About to Fail (and How to Prevent It)

A broken air conditioner in the middle of a Phoenix summer is a nightmare. But often, your AC will give you warning signs before it fails completely. Learning to recognize these signs can save you from a sweltering emergency and potentially expensive repairs.

Here are five key signs that your AC is about to fail, and what you can do about it.

## 1. Strange Noises

Your AC unit should operate with a consistent, low hum. If you start hearing new or unusual noises, it's a red flag.

*   **Grinding or Squealing:** This could indicate a problem with the motor bearings.
*   **Banging or Clanking:** This might mean a loose or broken part, like a connecting rod or piston.
*   **Bubbling or Hissing:** This is a classic sign of a refrigerant leak.

**What to do:** If you hear any of these noises, turn off your AC unit immediately to prevent further damage and call a professional for an inspection.

## 2. Weak Airflow

If you notice that the air coming out of your vents is weaker than usual, it's a sign that your system is struggling. This is often caused by a clogged air filter, but it can also indicate a more serious problem with the compressor or ductwork.

**What to do:** First, check your air filter. If it's dirty, replace it. If the problem persists with a clean filter, it's time to call for service.

## 3. Blowing Warm Air

If your AC is running but the air coming out of the vents is warm or lukewarm, you have a problem. This could be caused by a refrigerant leak or a broken compressor.

**What to do:** Check your thermostat to make sure it's set to "Cool." If it is, and you're still getting warm air, you need to call a technician.

## 4. Frequent Cycles

Your AC should run for a reasonable amount of time to cool your home and then shut off. If you notice it turning on and off every few minutes (a "short cycle"), it's a sign that the system is not working efficiently. This could be due to an oversized unit, a faulty thermostat, or a refrigerant charge issue.

**What to do:** Short cycling puts a lot of strain on your AC unit and can lead to premature failure. Schedule a maintenance check-up to diagnose the root cause.

## 5. Moisture or Leakage

Your AC unit is designed to manage condensation, but you should never see puddles of water or active leaks around your indoor unit. This could be a sign of a clogged condensate drain line, which can cause water damage and shut down your system.

**What to do:** Turn off your AC and call a professional. A clogged drain line is usually a simple fix, but if left unaddressed, it can lead to much bigger problems.

## How to Prevent AC Failure

The single best way to prevent an emergency AC failure is with regular, professional maintenance. An annual tune-up allows a technician to spot and fix small problems before they become big ones, clean the system for optimal efficiency, and ensure it's ready for the demands of a Phoenix summer.
