## What Our Scottsdale Customers Say

> "I was in a complete panic when my AC went out in the middle of a July afternoon. I live just off Shea Boulevard and was worried it would take forever to get someone out. I called Phoenix Emergency AC Repair, and they had a technician at my door in under three hours. He was professional, courteous, and had my system running in about an hour. I can't recommend them enough!"
