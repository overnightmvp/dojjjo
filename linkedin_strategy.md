# Johnny Toshio's LinkedIn Content Strategy & Implementation Plan

## Profile Optimization Checklist

### Headline (Instead of just "Product Designer")
**Option 1:** "Product Designer & BJJ Coach | Failed 4 startups across 4 countries | Helping founders turn ideas into validated acquisition data overnight with AI"

**Option 2:** "I help founders build Overnight MVPs | Product Designer | BJJ Coach | Failed 3x before figuring it out | Now building from Bangkok"

### About Section Template
```
Failed 3 startups. Lost everything. Over $100.000 in the hole.

That taught me what actually matters: 
→ Simple beats complex every time
→ Systems create freedom
→ One landing page can generate serious revenue

Now I help founders avoid my mistakes.

My Overnight MVP framework helps founders turn ideas into Data driven products in weeks, not months.

🎯 What I do: Product design + MVP development + business systems 
🥋 Side quest: Teaching Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu + Make music
📍 Location: Bangkok, Thailand
💡 Philosophy: Build fast, fail faster, succeed eventually

## Content Templates

### Template 1: Failure Story Hook
```
I lost 80% of my revenue in a single phone call.

My biggest client (paying $15k/month) called to say they were "going in a different direction."

Just like that, my 6-figure agency became a $3k problem.

Here's what I learned:

[3-5 lessons]

The lesson? [Main takeaway]

What's the biggest business failure that taught you the most?
```

### Template 2: MVP Education Post
```
Your MVP is probably too complicated.

I see founders trying to build the "Uber of X" when they should be building a simple landing page.

Here's how to simplify:

1. [Actionable tip]
2. [Actionable tip]  
3. [Actionable tip]

Remember: Simple can be powerful.

You don't need a million-dollar marketing campaign.
A single landing page can generate serious revenue.

What's one thing you can remove from your MVP today?
```

### Template 3: Behind-the-Scenes Bangkok Life
```
Running a business from Bangkok hits different.

While you're fighting traffic, I'm:
→ Taking client calls from a rooftop café
→ Teaching BJJ at 6 PM (my real passion)
→ Building MVPs that work while I sleep

This isn't about showing off.
It's about designing a business that gives you options.

Systems > hustle
Freedom > fancy offices
Results > being busy

What would you do if your business could run from anywhere?
```

### Template 4: Quick Value Post
```
The fastest way to validate your idea:

Build a landing page.
Write compelling copy.
Drive 100 visitors.
See if anyone cares.

Takes 1 day, costs under $50.

Better than 6 months building something no one wants.

I've seen founders waste months on features when a simple page would have told them everything.

What are you building that you could test first with a landing page?
```
